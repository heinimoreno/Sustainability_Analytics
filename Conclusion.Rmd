# Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the necessity for ski resorts to leverage advanced technologies
and strategic diversification to adapt climate variability and ensure long-term viability. Using AI-driven
weather prediction tools is essential in order to plan snowmkaing and maintenance, optimizing resort operations
while complying with environmental regulations.

Additionally, ski resorts must continuously review and adjust operational practices to anticipate regulatory changes.
By staying proactive, resorts can adapt to legal requirements, mitigate environmental impacts, and maintain operational
efficiency.

Another important aspect is the diversification of resort attractions, with investments in summer sports infrastructure to
ensure year-round tourism resilience. This approach mitigates the risk associated with seasonal dependency and contributes
to economic stability. However, the ability to predict snow and weather conditions is limited due to a lack of extensive
date from weather stations. Expanding the network of such stations across ski resorts could substantially improve this situation.
By strategic placing, taking into account factors such as whether ski trails lie in sunny or shady areas, a deeper understanding
of local climate variations could be gained. Such detailed climate data would significantly refine weather predictions and
snowmaking plans, leading to more efficient and effective use of resources in resort operations.

Considering the research question about predicting the duration of effective snow-making using weather trends, our current
predictive capabilities are limited. The scarcity of detailed weather data and the complex nature of ski trail environments
make accurate forecasting challenging. Given additional time for investigation, we would focus on collecting more accurate
meteorological data, taking into account the particular characteristics of ski trail locations such as altitude, exposure
to sunlight, and patterns of shade. This precise approach to data gathering would enable us to develop more accurate predictive
models and provide informed forecasts about the future of snowmaking and its impact on winter sports destinations.
