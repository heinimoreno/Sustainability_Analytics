# Introduction
Nestled within Switzerland's alpine landscape, the ski resorts Engelberg-Titlis and Rigi-Kaltbad, 
alongside the communities of Engelberg and KÃ¼ssnacht, are facing the challenges posed by a shifting 
climate. The variability of snowfall has become a critical concern for these winter destinations, 
which are integral to the local economy due to their draw for tourism. In this context, the role of 
snowmaking machines emerges as a focal point of investigation for sustaining ski seasons and, by extension, 
the economic health of these regions.

Our analysis entails a comprehensive review of meteorological and snow cover data spanning from 1990 to 2024, 
accompanied by an examination of guest occupancy rates from 2013 onwards. This period includes the unique 
circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating adjusted models to account for the impact on tourism 
and resort operation.

Our research navigates through these varied datasets with an eye towards the future. The overarching question 
we seek to address is one of longevity and adaptability: Can snowmaking technology continue to support ski 
resort operations in the face of environmental and climatic changes? This inquiry is further refined by our 
commitment to the principles encapsulated in Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, and 9, ensuring that our 
approach to energy efficiency, economic growth, and innovation remains in line with global sustainability efforts.

## Research Question
In a scientific pursuit to inform strategic foresight for ski resorts, our core research question is articulated 
as follows: "How might we evaluate the efficacy of snow-making across various ski resorts to ensure optimal planning 
and sustainability for future seasons?"

## Method
Our investigation employs time series analysis using R to dissect decades of weather and snow data, alongside tourism 
occupancy rates. Key R packages aid in data cleansing and trend decomposition, revealing patterns and cyclicality. 
We perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between snowmaking, weather, and tourism. The predictive phase 
uses the ARIMA model to forecast future snowmaking needs and the sustainability of ski seasons, providing data-driven 
insights for strategic planning and long-term resort viability.

## Assumptions and Limitations
This study is conducted with the acknowledgment of several constraints. Notably, gaps exist within our datasets, with 
certain years missing valuable data points, and location-specific weather information proving elusive. Additionally, 
hotel occupancy rates, a key indicator of economic vitality, are available only from 2013 forward. These limitations 
necessitate assumptions to bridge data voids and infer trends. While such estimations enable a continuous analytical 
narrative, they also introduce a degree of uncertainty. As such, the findings and predictions presented must be 
interpreted with an understanding of these inherent constraints.
