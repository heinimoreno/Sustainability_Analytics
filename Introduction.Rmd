# Introduction
Located in the Swiss Alps, the ski resorts Engelberg-Titlis and Rigi-Kaltbad, along with the communities of
Engelberg and KÃ¼ssnacht, are facing significant challenges due to climate change. Especially winter tourism is
crucial for these areas, contributing 1% of Switzerland's GDP and 10-20% of economic output in certain regions.
The increasingly unpredictable reliability of snowfall, undermines the examination of snowmaking technologies
to sustain ski resort operations and regional economies.

The analysis is guided by the principles of Sustainable Development Goals 7 Affordable and Clean Energy,
8 Decent Work and Economic Growth, and 9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, focusing on energy efficiency,
economic sustainability, and innovation in addressing climate change impacts on winter tourism.

Considering th various stakholders involved, including Titlis and Rigi Bergbahnen, the International Ski 
Federation (FIS), TechnoAlpin, public transportation, and local culture, the analysis adopts a comprehensive
approach. This investigation encompasses meteorological and snow cover data from 1990 to 2024, alongside guest
occupancy rates from 2013 onwards. By applying this method the future viability of snowmaking as a method to 
mitigate climate change effects on ski resorts shall be assessed.

The objective is to evaluate sustainability of snowmaking technology in maintaining ski resort operations against
changing climate conditions, offering insights into the resilience and adaptability of the winter tourism in 
Switzerland.

## Research Question
In a scientific pursuit to inform strategic foresight for ski resorts, our core research question is articulated 
as follows: "How might we predict the duration of effective snow-making in coming years using weather trends, and 
understand its consequences for winter sports destinations?"

## Method
Our investigation employs time series analysis using R to dissect decades of weather and snow data, alongside tourism 
occupancy rates. Key R packages aid in data cleansing and trend decomposition, revealing patterns and cyclicality. 
We perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between snowmaking, weather, and tourism. The predictive phase 
uses the ARIMA model to forecast future snowmaking needs and the sustainability of ski seasons, providing data-driven 
insights for strategic planning and long-term resort viability.

## Assumptions and Limitations
This study is conducted with the acknowledgment of several constraints. Notably, gaps exist within our datasets, with 
certain years missing valuable data points, and location-specific weather information proving elusive. Additionally, 
hotel occupancy rates, a key indicator of economic vitality, are available only from 2013 forward. These limitations 
necessitate assumptions to bridge data voids and infer trends. While such estimations enable a continuous analytical 
narrative, they also introduce a degree of uncertainty. As such, the findings and predictions presented must be 
interpreted with an understanding of these inherent constraints.
